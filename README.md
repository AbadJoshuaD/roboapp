## This is the first application on Complete React Developer I have taken in Udemy.
Upon creating this application I have learned the basic boilerplate of React Application. The work arounds and creation of components. 
* Functional Components
* Class Components
I have also learned about **states and props** and how they are different from one another. This section of bootcamp also deepened my understanding on what React library do and what problem it resolving. Upon creating this application I am able to see hand in hand the changes being made by the **Virtual DOM** to the component only needs to be re render. Life cycle methods was also introduced here and how we can utilize this available methods React.
